FlareBot is a really cool bot, check it out here: [[!;;]https://flarebot.stream/])

I (BinaryOverload) am the current project manager of this brilliant project! With 
over [[;lightblue;]35 thousand servers] and over [[;lightblue;]a million users], there is plenty to do to keep
everything running stable. My main responsibities consist of managing the servers
to make sure everything runs smoothly and managing our internal policies and ways 
we code certain things.
